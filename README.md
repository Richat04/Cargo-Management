# ðŸš€ Galactic Cargo Management System (GCMS)
This project implements a space-efficient and time-optimized cargo management system for interstellar shipments, developed as part of COL106 Assignment 2. It uses advanced bin packing algorithms (Largest Fit and Compact Fit) to efficiently assign cargo to bins based on size and special handling requirements (color-coded).
